* local-push

* local-push

`local-push` allows you to push your CF application to your local docker container with actual buildpacks üê≥

* local-push

_DEMO_

.image img/local-push.gif 500 _

* local-push

User?

- Application developer who deploys & runs their service on CF

Why?

Application developer (at least me) wants *debug* application on own PC

- It's fast
- You can prepare test data and break it

* local-push vs. Others

BOSH Lite?

- It's very very heavy
- It's for who operates CF. Not for application developer

Nanocf?

  $ docker images 
  sclevine/nanocf  latest  f9b2dcf78699  4 weeks ago 7.43 GB

- It's also heavy
- You don't need all components

Don't provide bad experience to user.

* How local-push works? (1/2)

In one word, `local-push` emulates DEA environment with docker and cf-buildpack.

0. Bulding base docker image: `tcnksm/cf-buildstep`

- Forked `progrium/buildstep`
- Base image is `cloudfoundry/cflinuxfs2` (Same as DEA)
- Installing cf-buidpacks

(It's already uploaded on docker registry)

* How local-push works? (2/2)

1. Building docker image (tcnksm/local-push)

- Add application code
- Fetch dependencies and compile application with buildpack

2. Run container

- `docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 tcnkms/local-push`

* Benefit?

- Very light-weight ( base image size is around `1.1` GB )
- Extreamly fast build & boot by docker cache function
- Login to container and see what's happening by `docker exec`

* Install

Use `install-plugin` command,

  $ cf add-plugin-repo tcnksm https://t-plugins.au-syd.mybluemix.net
  $ cf install-plugin -r tcnksm local-push

* Next step?

- Interact with DB or MQ
- Integrate with LB (sending special header)
- Parse `manifest.yml`

* update-cli

* update-cli

`update-cli` allows you to update cf/cli to the latest version.

* update-cli

_DEMO_

.image img/update-cli.gif 500 _

* update-cli

Why?

I want this function on cf/cli itself. Kind of proposal to show how it great.

* How update-cli work?

Core of this plugin is [[https://github.com/tcnksm/go-latest][tcnksm/go-latest]]

  githubTag := &latest.GithubTag{
      Owner: "cloudfoundry",
      Repository: "cli",
  }

  res, _ := latest.Check(githubTag, "0.1.0")
  if res.Outdated {
    fmt.Printf("0.1.0 is not latest, you should upgrade to %s", res.Current)
  }

* Install

Use `install-plugin` command,

  $ cf add-plugin-repo tcnksm https://t-plugins.au-syd.mybluemix.net
  $ cf install-plugin -r tcnksm update-cli
