* What is boot2kubernetes?

Run single node kubernetes cluster in *one* *command* using docker üê≥

   $ boot2k8s up

Just this, it pulls required docker images and starts them. 

If you run docker on boot2kubernetes-vm, you need port forwarding for connecting api server via `kubectl`. `boot2k8s` automatically detects that and starts proxy server.

And easy to clean everything,

   $ boot2k8s destroy   

* Why did you build this?

Becasue kubernetes has reached the v1 milestone üéâ, it's good time to start!

It's important that:

- Anyone can try it more easily 
- Anyone can build test environment more quickly

* Inside boot2kubernetes 

boot2kubernetes is written by Go.

I experimentally [[https://github.com/docker/libcompose][docker/libcompose]] (& [[https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata][jtweeuwen/go-bindata]] ). `libcompose` is official golang implementation of docker-compose and we can use it as library from our code.
